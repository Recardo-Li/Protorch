  category_name: Structure
  tool_name: deepab
  tool_description: Predict the structure of an antibody from an Fv sequence (heavy chain and light chain).
  required_parameters:
  - name: heavy_chain_sequence
    type: SEQUENCE
    detailed_type: AA_SEQUENCE
    description: The amino acid sequence of the antibody's heavy chain.
  - name: light_chain_sequence
    type: SEQUENCE
    detailed_type: AA_SEQUENCE
    description: The amino acid sequence of the antibody's light chain.
  optional_parameters:
  - name: decoys
    type: INTEGER
    detailed_type: DECOY_NUM
    description: Number of decoys to create. The lowest energy decoy will be selected
      as final predicted structure.
    default: 5
  - name: renumber
    type: BOOLEAN
    detailed_type: RENUMBER
    description: Convert final predicted structure to Chothia format using AbNum.
      This allows for easier comparison of antibody structures and more accurate identification
      of key functional regions.
    default: true
  return_values:
  - name: antibody_structure
    type: PATH
    detailed_type: STRUCTURE_PATH
    description: The designed 3D structure of the antibody saved as a PDB file.
  return_scores:
  - name: rosetta_energy
    description: This score represents the â€‹final Rosetta energy (REU) of the refined structure, combining physical force-field terms and constraint satisfaction after full-atom minimization.
