This subsection of the Function section describes regulatory mechanisms for enzymes, transporters or microbial transcription factors, and reports the components which regulate (by activation or inhibition) the reaction.

Example: P17289

A regulation can be allosteric, performed by natural or synthetic products or may be due to a post-translational modification (PTM).
Examples: P0A9C5, Q96EB6

This subsection describes the regulation at the protein level. We do not describe genetic regulation.

Note that the absence of a regulation can also be reported (usually if other members of the family are regulated by a given component).

This annotation topic used to be called "Enzyme regulation" prior to release 2018_08.
