This subsection of the 'Function' section describes the metabolic pathway(s) associated with a protein.

Example: P77731

The 'Pathway' subsection uses a structured hierarchy of controlled vocabulary. Each process is split up into 'super-pathway', 'pathway' and/or 'sub-pathway' associated with the protein. When known, the step number mediated by the protein within the pathway is also indicated.

Example: P20580

When the metabolic pathway is not fully known, we only indicate the super-pathway and pathway labels.

Example: Q47316

When a protein participates in different pathways or in different steps of the same pathway, they are all listed on individual lines in the 'Pathway' subsections.

Example: P00562
