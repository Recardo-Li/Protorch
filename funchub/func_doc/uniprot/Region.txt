This subsection of the 'Family and Domains' section describes a region of interest that cannot be described in other subsections.

It may be used to describe characteristics of a region that have been experimentally defined, such as the role of a region in mediating protein-protein interactions or some other biological process, to describe the different regions in multifunctional enzymes or fusion proteins, or to fully describe the characteristics of a region containing repeats.

Examples: Q8CJF7, P26948, Q8BUZ1, P25490, P13475, O76041, P08796, P54602, P03879
