This subsection of the 'Family and domains' section provides general information on the biological role of a domain. The term 'domain' is intended here in its wide acceptation, it may be a structural domain, a transmembrane region or a functional domain. Several domains are described in this subsection.

The domains described in this subsection are generally also described at the sequence level (cf. 'Domains and Repeats' subsection).
Example: Q96NN9

This subsection contains also information, such as the location, length and function of domains that have no precise name and that cannot be described at the sequence level.
