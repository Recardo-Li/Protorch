This subsection describes interesting single amino acid sites on the sequence that are not defined in any other subsection. This subsection can be displayed in different sections ('Function', 'PTM / Processing', 'Disease/Phenotypes and variants') according to its content.

Examples: P00451, Q10471, P80969, P02730

The 'Site' subsection is frequently used for:

1. Cleavage sites
Example: P09884

When the protease is known, it is specified:
Example: Q8K1S2

Autocatalytic cleavages are specified:
Example: Q02936

Related keyword: Autocatalytic cleavage

2. Inhibitory sites for proteases
Example: P00995

When the protease that is subject to inhibition is known, it is specified:
Example: P01070

Related keyword: Protease inhibitor

3. Breakpoint sites for fusion proteins due to chromosomal rearrangement
Example: Q9UDY8

Related keyword: Chromosomal rearrangement

Each 'Site' subsection may refer to a single amino acid or to a peptide bond, which is represented by the positions of the two flanking amino acids.
