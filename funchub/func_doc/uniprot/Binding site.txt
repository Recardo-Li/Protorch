This subsection of the Function section describes the interaction between protein residues and a chemical entity. Priority is given to the annotation of physiological ligands (metals, cofactors, substrates and products of enzymes, allosteric regulators, physiological inhibitors/activators, ligands of receptors/sensors and transporters/channels, effectors of transcriptional regulators, chromophores...).

In this subsection, we primarily annotate data originating from 3D structures.

The exact nature of the ligand is described by its identifier in the ChEBI ontology, and the corresponding UniProt name. Example: P45568

Historically, many ligands were described by the word "substrate", and have thus no associated ChEBI ID. These should be re-curated/retrofitted over time, replacing "Substrate" by the ligand name of the compound seen in the 3D structure.

Example: P00507

Binding annotations most often refer to a single amino acid residue, but can sometimes correspond to a range of residues.

Interactions which occur via post-translationally modified residues are specified.

Example: P27708

Interactions are considered to be non-covalent by default. When a substance is covalently bound with a cofactor or a prosthetic group, this is indicated by using the qualifier 'covalent'.

Example: P39186

This subsection complements the information on covalent binding described in the Modified residue, Glyosylation and Lipidation subsections as well as the information in the Active site subsection concerning unstable reaction intermediates.

In this subsection, we do not annotate general protein-protein interactions. These can be found in relevant subsections of the Interaction section.
