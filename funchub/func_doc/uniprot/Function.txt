This subsection of the Function describes the function(s) of a protein.

When a protein is a precursor of different chains/peptides having different functions, we specify the role of each peptide in separate paragraphs.
Examples: Q8MMJ7, Q9UBU3

The same holds true for isoform-specific functions.
Example: P16157

Multifunctional enzymes should have only one 'Function' section for the different activities.
Example: P0A9Q8

When a protein displays some very different or contradictory functions depending on the context, they are described in different sentences. This case is rare.
Example: Q8WVD3

Note that physiological ligands of receptors are cited in this section, and not in the 'Interaction' section.
Example: P29317
