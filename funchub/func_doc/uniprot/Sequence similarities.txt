This subsection of the 'Family and domains' section provides information about the sequence similarity with other proteins.

This subsection only states sequence similarity, thus excluding proteins with a related name that may function in the same biological pathway, but do not share sequence similarities.

The 'Sequence similarities' subsection provides information on protein families the protein belongs to.

The lines are listed in alphanumerical order.

Examples: Q9C9W3, Q03395, Q15022, P0A6X0, O31792

A protein may belong to two (or even more) different families. In this case, we indicate which part of the protein belongs to a given family.

Example: P40939, O75521
