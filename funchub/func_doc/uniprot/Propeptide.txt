This subsection of the PTM / Processing section describes a propeptide, which is a part of a protein that is cleaved during maturation or activation. Once cleaved, a propeptide generally has no independent biological function.

Examples: P29958, P21588

This subsection is only present when the existence of the propeptide has been demonstrated experimentally in the protein concerned or in a closely related homolog.
Example: Q8WXQ8

Each propeptide has a stable identifier.

We do not annotate the 2 to 4 basic amino acid residues regions produced by basic-specific proconvertase cleavage as a 'Propeptide', since these short oligopeptides are degraded and are generally not considered as bona fide propeptides.
