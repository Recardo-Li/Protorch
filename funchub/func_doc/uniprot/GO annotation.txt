The Gene Ontology (GO) describes knowledge of the biological domain with respect to three aspects:

Molecular function
Biological process
Cellular component
A variety of groups, including UniProtKB curators, use GO terms to annotate gene products in a computationally tractable manner. UniProt lists the annotated GO terms in the 'Function' section; the GO terms from the 'Cellular component' category can also be seen in 'Subcellular location' section. The project that made the annotation is shown as the 'Source', and a click on this label will display the supporting type of evidence. When available, a link to the relevant publications is provided.

Note that many UniProtKB subcellular locations and keywords have been mapped to GO terms to allow an automatic assignment of the corresponding GO terms. While the original UniProtKB subcellular locations and keywords are curated in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, their automatically mapped GO term equivalents will have the evidence type "Inferred from electronic annotation".

What are the differences between UniProtKB keywords and the GO terms?

What is the difference between the GO annotation included in UniProtKB's 'Ontologies' section, and the information accessible via the link 'Complete set of GO annotations'?
