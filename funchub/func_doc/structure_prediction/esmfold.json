    "tool_description": "This tool utilizes ESMFold to efficiently predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins based on their sequences. ESMFold is better suited for proteins lacking homologous sequence information because it does not depend on multiple sequence alignment. For newly discovered or rare proteins, ESMFold may hold certain advantages.",
