    "tool_description": "BLAST is a widely used bioinformatics tool for searching sequence databases. Given a protein or nucleotide sequence as input, it performs a BLAST search against a specified database to identify sequences that are similar or homologous to the query sequence. The tool sends the query to the NCBI BLAST server, waits for the results, and retrieves the most relevant matches, providing insights into potential functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships.",
