        "description": "If you are asked to do some prediction task, use these tools. These tools are based on the ProteinLLM model, which is a large language model trained on protein sequences. And you can use the pretrained model to do abundant downstream tasks. The tasks include regression, mutation, pair regression, classification, token classification, and pair classification on specific biomedical tasks, such as stability prediction and fitness prediction. Also, you can finetune your own model to proceed a new task if you have enough data.",
